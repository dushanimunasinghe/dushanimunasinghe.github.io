**Abstract:** In optical communication systems, Phase Sensitive Amplifier (PSA) is well known for its superior noise performance in the sub-quantum limit. Therefore, PSAs are highly suitable for long haul transmission systems where amplification and regeneration is critical. In this paper, we analyze the gain performance of a single pump non-degenerate PSA operating in the quadratic gain regime. The variation of gain characteristics with pump power and fiber length has been discussed. It could be seen that for a 5km long fiber, increasing of pump power above 4W subjected to the increasing of amplifier gain while maintaining the relative phase at a stable constant value of 0.001 rad. Therefore, by fine tuning parameters like fiber nonlinearity, pump power and fiber length, a phase stabilized gain performance of the PSA could be achieved when it is operating in the quadratic gain regime.

**Abstract:** In this paper we demonstrate the Optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) and Dispersion characteristics of Four-Wave Mixing (FWM) based optical carrier recovery scheme for a 10-Gb/s nonreturn-to-zero binary phase-shift-keyed input. The performance was evaluated by measuring the linewidth of the recovered carrier against different OSNR and accumulated dispersion values and recording the eye diagrams. The system characterization will enable new avenues of using the FWM based carrier recovery system in phase-sensitive amplification and heterodyne detection.

**Abstract:** This work theoretically investigates the influence of intensity and frequency noise on the locking range of a semi-conductor laser. The analysis was conducted using the numerical simulations based on the developed locking range model including the noise sources. The effect of intensity noise resulted in a broadening of the locking range by shifting its lower boundary along the detuning frequency axis and the effect of frequency noise has shifted the locking range without changing the locking range width. When intensity and frequency noise are considered simultaneously, the locking range shows a superposition of the individual variation of each type of noise. The results obtained through this work is applicable only for the lower injection ratio applications such as optical sensors.
