**Polarization-Insensitive Phase Sensitive Optical Amplifier for Phase Regeneration**
In optical communication, Phase Sensitive Amplifiers (PSAs) are well-known for their superior noise performance. In this research, a novel PSA configuration is proposed which implements a polarization-insensitive phase sensitive fiber optic parametric amplifier for phase regeneration. The proposed design can be used to address the inherent gain degradation issue in a polarization sensitive phase sensitive amplifier. This research investigates the possibilities for a significant gain enhancement when the polarization diversity loop is implemented.

# Final Year Projects Supervision:

  **Design and Development of a Microstrip Patch Antenna Array using Beamforming Techniques for Effective Free Space Transmission**
  - Objective: Develop a high performance antenna array with an optimized feeding technique for performance enhancement in free space transmission.
  - This  research focuses on developing a linear Microstrip Patch Antenna (MPA) array which has enhanced performance in terms of gain, directivity, VSWR and return loss using a novel beamforming technique. The main purpose is to design an optimum feeder network based on a suitable Butler matrix configuration considering the parameters such as phase shifter values and hybrid coupler designs. The project involves three phases inclusing, the design phase which is carried out using Ansys FHSS and CST Studio Suite software tools, the prototyping phase in which the student is required to develop a wireless transmitter incorporating the optimized MPA design and the characterization phase in which the array beam is characterised using a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA).

  **Two-Wheeled Self-Balancing Robot Simulator for Distance Learning**
  - Objective: Provide an alternative platform for remote controls engineering experiments.
  - This research explores the development of a simulation-based platform for remote controls engineering experiments, using a two-wheeled self-balancing robot as the testbed. By combining advanced mathematical modeling, CAD simulations, and real-time control strategies like PID, LQR, and Kalman filtering, the study demonstrates the feasibility of conducting hands-on experiments without physical hardware. The simulation platform, developed in MATLAB SimScape, accurately mimics the dynamics of a physical prototype, providing students and researchers a cost-effective and flexible tool for distance learning. This approach paves the way for innovative remote education solutions, especially during times of restricted physical access to laboratories.
 
  **IoT-Enabled Portable Condition Monitoring Device**
  - Objective: Develop a cost-effective solution for industrial predictive maintenance through vibration and ambient condition monitoring.
  - This research presents an innovative IoT-enabled portable condition monitoring (CM) device designed for industrial predictive maintenance (PdM). The device integrates vibration analysis and environmental sensing to identify machine faults and monitor ambient conditions. Using cost-effective components like the ESP32 microcontroller and MPU6050 accelerometer, the device transmits data wirelessly via MQTT for offline analysis. Advanced signal processing techniques, including Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Hilbert Transform, and Envelope Spectrum Analysis, are employed to detect bearing faults with precision. The device serves as a proof-of-concept for scalable, multi-node CM systems, providing small-to-medium-scale industries with an affordable and effective alternative to traditional preventive maintenance tools.
