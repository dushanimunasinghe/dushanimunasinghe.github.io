**Polarization-Insensitive Phase Sensitive Optical Amplifier for Phase Regeneration**

<p align="justify">
In optical communication, Phase Sensitive Amplifiers (PSAs) are well-known for their superior noise performance. In this research, a novel PSA configuration is proposed which implements a polarization-insensitive phase sensitive fiber optic parametric amplifier for phase regeneration. The proposed design can be used to address the inherent gain degradation issue in a polarization sensitive phase sensitive amplifier. This research investigates the possibilities for a significant gain enhancement when the polarization diversity loop is implemented.

  **Design and Development of a Microstrip Patch Antenna Array using Beamforming Techniques for Effective Free Space Transmission**

*Objective: Develop a high performance antenna array with an optimized feeding technique for performance enhancement in free space transmission.*
  - <p align="justify"> This  research focuses on developing a linear Microstrip Patch Antenna (MPA) array which has enhanced performance in terms of gain, directivity, VSWR and return loss using a novel beamforming technique. The main purpose is to design an optimum feeder network based on a suitable Butler matrix configuration considering the parameters such as phase shifter values and hybrid coupler designs. The project involves three phases inclusing, the design phase which is carried out using Ansys FHSS and CST Studio Suite software tools, the prototyping phase in which the student is required to develop a wireless transmitter incorporating the optimized MPA design and the characterization phase in which the array beam is characterised using a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA).
